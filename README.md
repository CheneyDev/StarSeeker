# 🌟 StarSeeker - AI-Powered GitHub Star Search

> Find your starred repositories effortlessly using natural language search

## 🎯 Overview

StarSeeker is a Chrome extension that revolutionizes how you search through your GitHub starred repositories. Instead of remembering exact repository names, simply describe what you're looking for in natural language, and let AI help you find it.

## 🤔 The Problem

Have you ever found yourself in this situation?
- You remember starring an interesting project but can't recall its name
- GitHub's native search requires exact repository names
- Scrolling through hundreds of starred repositories is time-consuming

- Enabling natural language search across your starred repositories
